# Project Title: MRI Guided ML: Early Detection & Alzheimers Forecating

## Overview
This project investigates the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Starting with an overview of AD and its symptoms like memory loss and body imbalance, the study delves into how the model detects AD, focusing on hippocampal tissue shrinkage and increased white matter in the brain. By evaluating the CNN algorithm, factors such as accuracy, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and upgradability are assessed to identify the best AD detection approach. The research employs CNNs in software engineering to develop a precise and early AD detection system using MRI scans, aiming to detect AD early and reduce healthcare costs while emphasizing data quality and robust model development.

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome is a highly accurate CNN model capable of effectively classifying different AD stages, providing better diagnostic tools for patients and healthcare providers. Utilizing a dataset of 5,000 MRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the study achieves a testing accuracy of 95.17%, showcasing the effectiveness of CNNs in AD classification. This result represents a significant advancement in early detection methods for AD and highlights the transformative potential of machine learning in improving diagnostic practices and patient outcomes.

## Experimentation and Validation
The project includes experimentation and validation of CNN models trained for 50, 100, and 200 epochs. Additionally, the misclassified images and confusion matrix are analyzed to gain insights into the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

- Experimentation:
In our experimentation and validation process, we conducted training runs for varying numbers of epochs to assess the performance of our model in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. For the first set of experiments comprising 50 epochs, our model achieved a commendable accuracy of 91%. Subsequently, we extended the training duration to 100 epochs, resulting in a notable improvement as our model attained a perfect training accuracy of 100%, while the testing accuracy reached an impressive 95%. Encouraged by these promising results, we further extended the training duration to 200 epochs. Remarkably, our model's accuracy surged to an exceptional 99%, demonstrating the robustness and efficacy of our approach in effectively classifying different stages of AD with increasing training epochs. These findings underscore the significance of prolonged training durations in enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle patterns indicative of AD, thus showcasing the potential of our methodology in facilitating early detection and prognosis of the disease.
